# DC_meter_prototype
This project is an IoT-enabled instrumentation device designed to measure Direct Current (DC) parameters—Voltage, Current, Power, and Energy—in real-time. Unlike traditional AC energy meters, this system is specifically architected for DC-powered ecosystems like batteries, renewable solar modules, and embedded electronics
